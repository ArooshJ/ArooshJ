# Hello, I'm [Your Name]

## About Me

I'm a tech enthusiast with a profound interest and passion for programming. I'm actively engaged in learning new skills and continuously improving myself. My journey in the world of technology has led me to become familiar with various programming languages such as Java, C++, and Python.

I have a solid foundation in both frontend and backend web development, thanks to my experience with frameworks like React.js and Django. I've already started building responsive web applications using these frameworks, which showcases my practical skills and dedication to mastering new technologies.

My curiosity doesn't stop at web development. I'm deeply intrigued by the fascinating field of Quantum Computing, and I've embarked on a journey to explore this realm through Qiskit. This journey aligns perfectly with my drive to delve into complex topics and unravel their mysteries.

## Goals and Aspirations

My enthusiasm for technology and my determination to learn and excel are at the core of my aspirations. I'm passionate about continuous growth, both in technical skills and non-technical aspects. While I haven't had the opportunity to lead committees, I've taken up leadership roles in various group activities and found immense satisfaction in guiding and collaborating with others.
